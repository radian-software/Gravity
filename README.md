# Gravity

This was a Christmas present that I made for my father back in
December 2013. It is an iOS app that simulates many-body Newtonian
gravity. Unfortunately, Apple makes it basically impossible to build
any project that you created more than a year ago, so there's no way I
can get a screenshot for you... sorry :)
