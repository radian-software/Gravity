# Gravity

This was a Father's Day present that I made many years back. It is an
iOS app that simulates many-body Newtonian gravity. Unfortunately,
Apple makes it basically impossible to build any project that you
created more than a year ago, so there's no way I can get a screenshot
for you... sorry :)
